# History 
The release of the [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/) gaming ecosystem by [Sky Mavis](https://www.skymavis.com/) introduced the world to the concept of playing games while earning a income in the process. A concept now known as "play to earn". To gamers around the world, this was their Holy Grail moment. The opportunity to play a game(s) while getting paid to do such; and they flocked to the world of the Axies by the millions. 

The success of this game and its online ecosystem has not been lost on other gaming developers. Now dozens of "play to earn" games have been released while many others are in development. You want to be a God and rule the world, now you can with [Gods Unchained](). You want to be a medieval King or Queen and lead your armies against other kingdoms, now you can in [CityStates: Medieval](https://citystatesm.com/). How about getting dropped into a zombie filled world were you have to shoot your way to freedom? You can do that with [Zombie Rising]()? What about exploring outer space, and seeing strange new worlds? [Alien Worlds](https://alienworlds.io/) will take you there and beyond. 

What separates "play to earn" games from your typical online, massive multiple player online games by such companies as [Blizzard Entertainment](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/) or [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) is that these "play to earn" games incorporate non-fungible tokens (NFT) that allow players to not only create unique characters, BUT, they then own these characters as one would own a piece of art or share of stock in a company. 

The creator/owner of these NFT characters/images/objects are then able to sell, trade, exchange, their NFT's as they see fit within their respective gaming ecosystem. This unique ability to exchange these objectified NFT's allows for the commoditization of such in the same manner that individual traders exchange corn, gold, stocks or bonds within their respective public exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade. 

As with all free markets, at times supply and demand factors can cause asset prices to rise beyond the grasp of the average consumer resulting in extreme inflationary pressures. This inflationary specter caused the world of the Axies to become exorbitantly expensive (reaching a peak of $1,500.00 for a starter set) and thus shutting out many willing players who could not afford the startup costs. And, if you are in a local economy where you are making only a few dollars a day, that magical set of Axies that costs $1,500.00 US dollars might as well be a million dollars. It is just too expensive for you to purchase to play a game when those dollars would go a long way to feeding your family.

And, here-in lies the business opportunity.


# The Business Model
Does Dick Sporting Goods create games? Or, do they sell the equipment to you to have fun playing games?

A business could operate within the "play to earn" gaming environments acquiring assets, lands, characters, and other in-game non-fungible tokens. The business could then act as a material goods "Lender" to players who cannot afford the upfront costs of such gaming NFT's. The "Lendee" player's character could now be outfitted with sufficient in-game resources that they could play at an above average starting point making their game play more rewarding than those who simply "boot-strap" themselves into the game ecosystem(s) starting from scratch. 

In order to incentivize such an arrangement, the Lender/Lendee (as an example) could split the in-game earnings 30/70. Thirty percent going to the "Lender” and seventy percent going to the "Lendee." If a player tires of the gaming ecosystem they simply surrender the borrowed assets the same way as one would return a library book to their local library. The player keeps their seventy percent of the earnings and any other tokens they accumulated, and everyone leaves the game a winner. If the player decides they want to play within another gaming ecosystem they could come back to the "Lender" and simply "check-out" another character or other specialized tokens and explore the next "play to earn" world and again split their respective earnings with the "Lending" entity.

## The "Nuts and Bolts"
Do Librarians build libraries? Or, do they simply lend out books?

With this model we do not have to program any NFT's. We simply work within the gaming ecosystem and let them do the heavy lifting of the blockchain programing, the firewall security, the NFT development, server hosting and any other of the mechanics needed to host an online ecosystem. We simply buy, develop and lend or sell the NFT's to the newer upcoming players. 

We can use the knowedge obtained within the Fintech Bootcamp program to build out external features that would then add to our business supporting our growth and development. These Fintech Bootcamp applications are discussed here:


# Machine Learning Demonstration
Why is Machine Learning important for this business model? 

As more and more "play to earn" games emerge it stands to reason those gamers will move from one ecosystem to another till they find one game(s) that best meets their playing needs. Using Machine Learning we can use predictive modeling to help us understand the direction of the games market publicly traded value which can help to indicate whether or not to buy or sell NFT assets within that gaming ecosystem. 

Using Machine Learning we used pricing predictive models of four "play to earn" games that are publicly traded (Coinbase or KuCoin). We chose the following four games:
1. [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/)
2. [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/)
3. [Gods Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/)
4. [Pegaxy](https://pegaxy.io/)

With Machine Learning, we found that all four gaming tokens are below their expected predicted valuations. Furthermore, they each demonstrate an ongoing downward trend, which could signal a warning. However, in our current economic environment, all financial assets are experiencing unique stressors during this period of turmoil. Even stalwart investments such as Facebook, Apple, and Target have seen severe reductions in their valuations. 

In the folder labeled "Machine Learning" are the four CSV files for the above noted tokens.  Each was run using the Tensor Flow modeling. The CSV's were derived from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKXROKVwGzTyekoPeZxp1NhMZQ_30RSAq3n6_Y4Gz9o4Wbz3bltWbwnWi5qacicHVUt-7_YeEiIqUgZ_36eqfm3t1EAYvReYedHm_KwNm9beBlhFgza6y06oDb7feC9RC2bx22IhbJIUMyTIkiLi4saqO2ASbbe7UbPspOYuzeL8)

# Recommendation Engine (New Technology)
What are Recommendation Engines?

We have all seen recommendation engines at work; shop on Amazon, watch movies on Netflix, surf the web much? Recommendation Engines are software that take the data that you input into websites and return a recommendation based on your interests. The concept is easy; it is vendor upselling in an effort to get you too spend more time or money within their ecosystem before you leave their website.

For example, if you are building an adventure character in the world of [Cryptoblades](Cryptoblades.io) and you need a magical sword. You could input that you need to borrow a +3 broadsword into one of our databases. Our recommendation engine sees that and also recommends from our inventory of NFT goods a magical bow and arrow, some mystical battle armor and maybe even a enchanted helmet to finish outfitting your character. As these items are "borrowed" by the player to further outfit his or her NFT, they now have a character more advanced than when they first started, and are now better able to handle the upcoming quest to kill the infamous red dragon. Their rewards are higher and using our 70/30 split, the business revenue is higher.

We have added a recommendation engine to interpret consumer imports and derive a recommendation export. The KNN Algorithm (K-Nearest Neighbor) is used for classification and looks to assigns new data based on how close or similar the data is to the points in the training data. 

This recommendation engine example was found during research and is modeled using a CSV file from [Steam](store.steampowered.com) that uses their customer base to and based on their inputs to present similar games that the customer may want to play. A second recommendatoin engine was developed using a Pokeman database. 

# ICO (Initial Coin Offering)

As a type of digital crowdfunding, ICOs enable startups not only to raise funds without giving up equity but also to establish a community of incentivized users who want the project to succeed so their presale tokens rise in value.

1. Decide on the Crowdsale’s Goal
2. Establish Guidelines and Rules
3. Promote Their Cryptocurrency to Potential Investors 

Crowdsale

A cryptocurrency crowdsale is a public offering to invest in a new cryptocurrency or other digital asset, such as a non-fungible token (NFT). Cryptocurrency crowdsales can raise funds for anything related to cryptocurrency or blockchain, including development in a project or new business. Some initial coin offerings use (ICOs) crowdfunding to raise money for development. In an ICO, a blockchain-based startup mints a certain quantity of its own native digital token and offers them to early investors, normally in exchange for other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or ether. Blockchain projects release their tokens to the general public via a crowdsale event. People who wish to support a new token participate in the crowdfund by purchasing their tokens using Ethereum or Bitcoin. At the end of the crowdfunding period, each participant receives tokens corresponding to how much they donated. But some organizations prefer to vest a certain amount of tokens.A certain amount of tokens that are held aside for some period of time for the team, partners, advisors, and others who are contributing to the development of the project. Smart contracts usually lock a certain amount of funds until contract conditions are met. For example, startups that use the blockchain technology can lock a certain amount of tokens: the team can reserve 15% of coins, for instance, which will be gradually released once a month/quarter/year during the project process for financial purposes. In general terms, the process of releasing these coins is called vesting. Vesting is usually used to show that the team is highly interested in the project, and will continue working on project development. Additionally, vesting lowers market price manipulations. 

Airdrop

Airdrops involve blockchain-based projects and developers sending out free tokens to members of their communities as part of a broader marketing initiative. The primary reason for organizing a crypto airdrop is to promote a blockchain startup, project or service. By issuing tokens to users, the team can bootstrap its project and ensure a fair distribution of tokens among its community from day one. Moreover, recipients of these tokens are incentivized to increase awareness and help the project reach a broader audience once the token begins trading on an exchange. The more interest surrounding the token, the more likely it will rise in price.

# Non-Fungible Token Demonstration
Why create our own non-fungible tokens? 

Amy to add /explain etc... All consumer based business now employ a "rewards" program to encourage and incentivise customers to return. We would like create our own non-fungible tokens that we could present to our customers as a reward system. Within these non-fungible tokens we could attach recognition for a job well done, coupon codes for NFT purchases, collectible tokens, or any other method of recognizing a customers attention and thanking them.

In the folder labeled "Non-Fungible Tokens you will find our code for five non-funigble tokens.

## In Game Mechanics
To minimize overhead costs this business model is designed to work within the host gaming ecosystems. For example, with Axie Infinity you would buy and sell NFT's within their specific Axie world ecosystem. You would then replicate this measure with CryptoQuest, Pegaxy and all the others. This prevents the need for external engineering costs to build and maintain software and hardware. The gaming systems themselves provide all of the engineering support and we just buy, build, sell and loan within their gaming ecosystem(s).

## External Mechanics
The external features discussed here (NFT's, airdrops, tokenization, machine learning) here can be implemented to support and energize the customer base. These mechanics could be used in the same manner that real world business (Target, Starbucks, McDonalds) reward and incentives their customers to use their apps and businesses. These measures learned in the Fintech Bootcamp are applicable in a realworld setting to generate brand excitement.

# Gaming Guilds
Gaming Guilds are collectives of individuals who have pulled their resources to stake and provide scholarships to other "play to earn" gamers. These Guilds operate as DAO's (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations). A decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, is a blockchain-based organization with rules enforced by smart contracts. DAOs can have several purposes, but their main function is to provide an automated way to carry out governance decisions voted on by its members using a governance token. 

Yield Guild is the most successful of these gaming guild with revenues reported to be around $100 million USD.

1. [Yield Guild](https://yieldguild.io/)
2. [Merit Circle Guild](https://meritcircle.io/)
3. [Good Games Guild](https://goodgamesguild.com/)

This business model is based on the Guilds, but with the focus of making a profit and expanding as a publicly traded enterprise.
